Title: A comparison of search algorithms, using an intelligent environment, on pathfinding problems; mazes.

Description: Creating an intelligent environment consisting of nodes which were intended to significantly reduce computational overheads. Common path-finding algorithms were used, this means Dijekstra, A*, Breadth and Depth First. The project also used an Genetic Algorithm which involved creating one which emulates evolution and natural selection we see in the living world.
